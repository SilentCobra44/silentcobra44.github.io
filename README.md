## 🧠 Introduction

The S&P 500, a benchmark index comprising 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., is a vital barometer of economic and market health. This project investigates whether it's possible to predict future stock prices using historical S&P 500 data, while also analyzing sector-level performance using data science and machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Data Source & Preparation

**Dataset:** [Kaggle S&P 500 5-Year Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500)  
**Size:** 619,000+ rows (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Ticker Symbol)  
**Steps Taken:**
- Removed missing data
- Filtered out outdated tickers
- Merged with sector classification CSV
- Cleaned and formatted for machine learning and statistical analysis

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

### Key Descriptive Stats:
- **Mean Price:** ~$83
- **Max Volume:** 618M shares
- **Tickers:** 500 stocks, 1,259 trading days

### Volatility Overview:
- **Highest:** PCLN, AMZN, GOOGL
- **Lowest:** AES, PBCT, NWS

## 🧪 Statistical Testing

### ✅ Chi-Square Test
**Question:** Is there a relationship between sector and volatility?  
**Result:** p = 0.058 → *Not statistically significant (but close)*

### ✅ Z-Test
**Goal:** Difference in mean returns between high and low volatility groups (per sector)  
**Significant Sectors:**
- **Consumer Discretionary** (p = 0.006)
- **Consumer Staples** (p = 0.0036)

Others showed no significant deviations.

### ✅ ANOVA Test
**Goal:** Are sector-level daily returns significantly different?  
- **F-Statistic:** 0.733  
- **p-Value:** 0.623 → *No significant difference*

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

### Features Used:
- Previous closing price
- 5-day and 30-day moving averages
- 5-day volatility
- 5/30 average ratio
- Previous day return

### Neural Network Structure:
- Input: 6 features
- Layers: 64 → 32 → 1 neurons (ReLU)
